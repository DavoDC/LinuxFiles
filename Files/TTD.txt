### THINGS TO DO ###


# CONFIGURE_DOTFILES.sh

WHENEVER CONFIG IS WANTED - check dotfiles exist - create helper function 

USE HELPER FUNCTIONS - for windows too

Also test windows case = what if already there?
On Windows = If bash profile already exists, rename to "old"  OR DELETE 
When running , check for existence of "old" file - use to restore?
If umconfiguring , check fit file first . Ask user whether they want to backup or delete . Use function for both?


Once Windows perfected, do Linux + test on it 



# DOTFILES 
- Fix colors!!!



# GEN_SETUP.sh

Improve general setup script output -> 
make less verbose, centralize header printing to a function!
- put helper functions in a separate file!
