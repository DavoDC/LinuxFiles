### THINGS TO DO ###


# CONFIGURE_DOTFILES.sh

Factor checking for dorfilrs before config in general

Put found dot file paths at top


Also test windows case = what if already there?

USE HELPER FUNCTIONS - for windows too



If umconfiguring , check fit file first . Ask user whether they want to backup or delete . Use function for both?



Comment all functions and integrate as needed

On Windows = If bash profile already exists, rename to "old"  OR DELETE 
When running , check for existence of "old" file - use to restore?
