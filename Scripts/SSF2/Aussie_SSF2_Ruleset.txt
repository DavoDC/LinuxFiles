###Stage Striking
# Neutral Stages
At the start of a set, one person calls either "heads" or "tails". The Dyno bot command “>flip” is then used, and the winner of the coin flip bans the first stage from the neutral stages. The other person will then strike 2 stages, followed by the first person striking one last stage. The remaining stage is then played on.

# Counter Picking
The winner of the previous round bans 2 stages, the loser of the previous round picks the stage to be played on. You cannot pick the last stage you have won on. 

# Gentlemen’s Rule
If both players agree, you're able to play on any stage.

### Character Announcement
After stage striking has occurred, character announcements may be required, which can allow for character counter picking. In the first match of a given set, both players do not need to do any character announcing. In match 2 onwards of a set, both players must announce their characters, with the winner going first.
